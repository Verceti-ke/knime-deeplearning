	<name>Keras Dropout Layer</name>

	<shortDescription>
		A dropout layer.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		Applies dropout to the layer input.
		Dropout consists in randomly setting a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training 
		time, which helps prevent overfitting.
		Corresponds to the
		<a href="https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout">Keras Dropout Layer</a>.
		</intro>
		<tab name="Options">
		<option name="Name prefix">
			The name prefix of the layer. The prefix is complemented by an index suffix to obtain a unique layer name. If this option is unchecked, the name prefix is derived from the layer type.
		</option>
		<option name="Drop rate">
			Fraction of the input units to drop.
		</option>
		<option name="Noise shape">
			The shape of the binary dropout mask that will be multiplied with the input.
			The noise shape has to include the batch dimension which means in case of 2D images with shape [height, width, channels], the noise shape must must have
			rank 4 i.e. [batch, height, width, channels].
			In order to reuse the dropout mask along specific dimensions set those to '1' in the noise shape other dimensions can be set to '?'.
			Spatial dropout where whole feature maps are dropped can be achieved by setting noise shape to '?, 1, 1, ?'.
		</option>
		<option name="Random seed">
			Random seed to use for the dropping.
		</option>
