	<name>Keras Alpha Dropout Layer</name>

	<shortDescription>
		An alpha dropout layer.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		Applies Alpha Dropout to the input.
		Alpha Dropout is a Dropout that keeps mean and variance of inputs to their original values, in 
		order to ensure the self-normalizing property even after this dropout. Alpha Dropout fits well 
		to Scaled Exponential Linear Units by randomly setting activations to the negative saturation value.
		Corresponds to the
		<a href="https://keras.io/layers/noise/#alphadropout">Keras Alpha Dropout Layer</a>.
		</intro>
		<tab name="Options">
		<option name="Name prefix">
			The name prefix of the layer. The prefix is complemented by an index suffix to obtain a unique layer name. If this option is unchecked, the name prefix is derived from the layer type.
		</option>
		<option name="Drop rate">
			The drop probability (as with <a href="https://keras.io/layers/noise/#dropout">Dropout</a>). 
			The multiplicative noise will have standard deviation sqrt(rate / (1 - rate)).
		</option>
		<option name="Noise shape">
			The shape of the binary dropout mask that will be multiplied with the input.
			The noise shape has to include the batch dimension which means in case of 2D images with shape [height, width, channels], the noise shape must must have
			rank 4 i.e. [batch, height, width, channels].
			In order to reuse the dropout mask along specific dimensions set those to '1'.
			Spatial dropout where whole feature maps are dropped can be achieved by setting noise shape to 'batch_size, 1, 1, feature_dim_size'.
		</option>
		<option name="Random seed">
			Random seed to use for the dropping.
		</option>
